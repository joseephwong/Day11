    "**I am reading “Weapons of Math Destruction” by Cathy O’Neil, a book that analyzes the potential dangers of implementing certain models in our society. I initially was drawn to this book because the pun in the title made me believe O’Neil’s writing style would be enjoyable to read. While reading, she exceeded my expectations. Her explanations are easy to comprehend and she makes the topics relatable to everyday life. For example, in chapter one, she claims her methodology of preparing meals for her family is a model, even if it is dynamic and only exists in her brain. It was interesting to think about models in a simplistic way, as basic as weighing other people’s preferences to make decisions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Furthermore, in chapter one, O’Neil began emphasizing how models have already been ingrained into our society. She references baseball statistics, a model currently used to rank players and predict opposing players’ habits. O’Neil asserts that this is a healthy model because the information regarding the model is publicly available and the data is continuously updated. Also, there is not much danger involved, as its main impact is on how the sports match will play out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meanwhile, a recidivism model has detrimental effects on its victims. It uses a questionnaire for prisoners to determine their “risk” level and whether their sentence should be shortened. The questions, although cannot explicitly ask about race, are highly connected to experiences certain demographics face. Harsher treatment towards these individuals takes away their opportunities which leads them to be more likely to commit a crime once they are released. This creates a vicious loop where the model is believed to be successful despite influencing the outcomes to match its conclusions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another example of a toxic cycle is found in school systems. In struggling schools, standardized tests scores may be analyzed to evaluate teacher performance. Teachers have the potential of being fired if their class does not improve their test scores. But, this model does not take into consideration other variables, such as a student’s home life, or other markers of a teacher’s success, like parent testimonials.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**I found it interesting how O’Neil mentioned that there is a seeming paradox regarding the validity of models compared to humans. Models are often definitively deemed “true” for using the data provided, even if there may be inaccuracies. On the other hand, humans must have concrete evidence if they ever hope to disprove a model’s results. Placing this much trust in a computer model is truly placing trust in its developers, as it is their biases that have a large influence on what the model outputs.**"
